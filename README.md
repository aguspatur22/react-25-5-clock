# 25 + 5 Clock

This project is a web-based timer that alternates between session and break intervals, commonly known as a Pomodoro Timer. It is designed to help users manage their work and break periods effectively, enhancing productivity and focus.

## Technologies Used

- React: Utilized for its component-based architecture, enabling efficient updates and rendering of the user interface.
- CSS: Used for styling the timer and controls to provide a clean and intuitive user experience.
- TypeScript: Offers type safety for variables and functions, enhancing code reliability and maintainability.

## Features

- Session and Break Intervals: Allows users to set the duration of work sessions and breaks.
- Dynamic Timer: The timer dynamically counts down session or break time and switches between them automatically.
- Adjustable Lengths: Users can increase or decrease the length of both session and break periods even during a session.
- Audio Notification: Plays an audio alert when the timer transitions from a session to a break and vice versa.
- Responsive Design: The timer interface is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Start/Pause and Reset: Includes controls to start or pause the timer and to reset it to default settings.
